# Prompting Techniques: Comparison Activity

## Activity

### 1. Basic Prompt
Explain how photosynthesis works.

---

### 2. Zero-Shot Prompt
Explain how photosynthesis works in simple terms suitable for a high-school student.

---

### 3. Few-Shot Prompt
Explain how photosynthesis works.

**Example 1:**  
Explain gravity: Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other. It keeps planets in orbit and makes things fall to the ground.

**Example 2:**  
Explain evaporation: Evaporation happens when liquid water gains heat and changes into water vapor.

**Task:**  
Using the style of the examples, explain photosynthesis in a simple, clear way.

### 4. Chain-of-Thought Prompt
Explain step-by-step how photosynthesis works.  
Start by identifying the inputs required, then describe the internal process happening inside the chloroplast, and finally describe the outputs produced.  
Then summarize everything in 2–3 simple sentences.

## Evaluation of Responses (Using the *Rubric-Based Evaluation* Method)

### Criteria:
- **Clarity:** How easy it is to understand  
- **Depth:** Level of detail included  
- **Accuracy:** Scientific correctness  
- **Structure:** Logical flow of information

### Analysis:
- **Basic Prompt:**  
  - *Clarity:* Moderate  
  - *Depth:* Low  
  - *Accuracy:* Good  
  - *Structure:* General explanation; lacks focus  
  - *Notes:* Broad instruction → vague response.

- **Zero-Shot Prompt:**  
  - *Clarity:* High  
  - *Depth:* Moderate  
  - *Accuracy:* Good  
  - *Structure:* More focused because audience is specified  
  - *Notes:* Adding context improves the answer quality.

- **Few-Shot Prompt:**  
  - *Clarity:* Very High  
  - *Depth:* High  
  - *Accuracy:* Very Good  
  - *Structure:* Strong due to examples  
  - *Notes:* Model imitates example style → more controlled output.

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**  
  - *Clarity:* Excellent  
  - *Depth:* Very High  
  - *Accuracy:* Excellent  
  - *Structure:* Explicit reasoning steps → detailed and thorough  
  - *Notes:* Best choice for complex explanations.

### Conclusion
Refining prompts—from basic to structured—dramatically increases accuracy, clarity, and reasoning depth.  
Chain-of-thought prompts typically yield the most thorough and logically organized responses.
